# SQLite + Qdrant Integration Test Status

## Summary

This document describes the integration test for the SQLite + Qdrant + Crawling workflow and the current challenges.

## Test Files

1. **`test_sqlite_qdrant_crawl_mcp.py`** - Full integration test using actual crawling functions
2. **`test_sqlite_qdrant_crawl_mcp_simple.py`** - Simplified test using sample data (WORKING ✅)

## Current Status

### Working: Simplified Test

The simplified test (`test-integration-sqlite-qdrant-simple`) is **fully functional** and demonstrates:
- ✅ Generating embeddings with OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- ✅ Storing vectors in Qdrant (in-memory mode)
- ✅ Performing semantic search
- ✅ Validating MCP-style workflow

**Run with:**
```bash
make test-integration-sqlite-qdrant-simple
```

### Blocked: Full Crawling Test

The full integration test (`test-integration-sqlite-qdrant`) successfully:
- ✅ Crawls the target website (https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow)
- ✅ Uses Crawl4AI with Playwright (chromium installed)
- ✅ Creates SQLite tables dynamically
- ✅ Uses actual `CrawlingService` from the project

**However, it's blocked by:**
- ❌ SQLite schema migration file dependency
- ❌ Credential service creating separate repository instances
- ❌ Multiple services trying to initialize the database with full schema

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Repository Factory Pattern

The project uses a factory pattern (`get_repository()`) that creates new repository instances. Our test creates a minimal-schema repository, but:

1. **Crawling Service** creates its own repository via `get_repository()`
2. **Credential Service** creates its own repository
3. **Each service** tries to initialize with the full schema
4. **Migration file** (`001_initial_schema.sql`) doesn't exist in the test environment

### Challenge 2: Tight Coupling with Credential Service

The `credential_service` is deeply integrated:
- Used by `CrawlingService` to get API keys
- Used by `embedding_service` to get provider credentials
- Used by `llm_provider_service` to get model configurations
- **All require database access** to load credentials

Even though `OPENAI_API_KEY` is in the environment, the services try to:
1. Load all credentials from database (`get_all_setting_records()`)
2. Check for active providers in database
3. Fall back to environment variables only after database fails

### Challenge 3: SQLite Repository Initialization

The `SQLiteDatabaseRepository` has a guard in `_get_connection()`:
```python
if not self._initialized and not skip_init:
    await self.initialize()
```

Every database operation triggers initialization, which looks for the migration file.

## Attempted Solutions

### ✅ Solution 1: Manual Table Creation
Created minimal schema directly in test fixture:
- `archon_sources`
- `archon_crawled_pages`
- `archon_page_metadata`
- `archon_settings`

**Result**: Works for the test repository, but services create their own instances.

### ✅ Solution 2: In-Memory Qdrant with Sync Client
Created wrapper for synchronous `QdrantClient` with async interface.

**Result**: Works perfectly! Qdrant in-memory mode is functional.

### ❌ Solution 3: Inject API Key into Settings Table
Inserted `OPENAI_API_KEY` into `archon_settings` table.

**Result**: Doesn't help because services create new repository instances that don't have our tables.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Mock Credential Service (Easiest)
Mock the `credential_service` in the test to return API keys without database access.

**Pros:**
- Would allow full integration test to work
- Tests actual crawling logic
- Minimal changes needed

**Cons:**
- Not a "pure" integration test
- Doesn't test credential service integration

### Option B: Create Full Schema Migration File
Create the actual `migration/sqlite/001_initial_schema.sql` file with all tables.

**Pros:**
- Fixes root cause
- Enables full integration testing
- Benefits other SQLite use cases

**Cons:**
- Requires creating and maintaining complete schema
- Schema needs to match Supabase schema
- More setup complexity

### Option C: Environment-First Credential Service
Modify credential service to check environment variables BEFORE database.

**Pros:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Better for testing
- Aligns with 12-factor app principles

**Cons:**
- Requires changes to production code
- May affect other use cases

## Current Recommendations

1. **For immediate validation**: Use the simplified test (`test-integration-sqlite-qdrant-simple`)
   - Fully demonstrates the workflow
   - Validates embeddings → Qdrant → search
   - ✅ Working and tested

2. **For full integration**: Consider Option B (create migration file)
   - Most correct long-term solution
   - Enables SQLite as first-class citizen
   - Required for SQLite production use anyway

3. **For quick wins**: Document that the complex test demonstrates:
   - ✅ Actual crawling works (Crawl4AI + Playwright)
   - ✅ SQLite repository interface works
   - ✅ Qdrant in-memory mode works
   - ❌ Full orchestration blocked by infrastructure, not logic

## Test Execution

### Working Test
```bash
# Simplified test (fully working)
make test-integration-sqlite-qdrant-simple
```

**Output**:
- Creates 3 sample documents
- Generates embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- Stores in Qdrant
- Performs semantic search
- Returns ranked results
- ✅ All assertions pass

### Blocked Test
```bash
# Full test (blocked by infrastructure)
make test-integration-sqlite-qdrant
```

**Output**:
- ✅ Successfully crawls GitHub page (4.24s)
- ✅ Creates source in SQLite
- ❌ Fails when storing documents (credential service error)
- ❌ No documents stored
- ❌ Cannot proceed to embedding/search steps

## Conclusion

**The core functionality is validated**:
- ✅ OpenAI embeddings work
- ✅ Qdrant vector storage works
- ✅ Semantic search works
- ✅ Crawling works (when isolated)
- ✅ SQLite repository interface works (with minimal schema)

**The integration challenge is infrastructure**:
- Multiple services need coordinated database setup
- Credential service tightly couples database and environment
- Migration file missing breaks initialization chain

**Recommendation**: Use the simplified test to validate the workflow, and address the infrastructure issues (migration file or environment-first credentials) separately as a project-wide improvement.
