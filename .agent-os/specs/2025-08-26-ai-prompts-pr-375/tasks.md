**Remove Dockerfile and Compose patterns from `.dockerignore`**  

Ignoring Dockerfiles or Compose files by default can break standard Docker workflows (e.g., `docker build .`) unless you always specify `-f` or pass an external path. In fact, developers have encountered build failures like:

> Error response from daemon: Cannot locate specified Dockerfile: Dockerfile  
> when `Dockerfile` is listed in `.dockerignore` without using `-f` ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47580298/can-dockerfile-be-put-in-dockerignore?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

While Docker‚Äôs documentation notes that you *can* exclude the Dockerfile via `.dockerignore` (it‚Äôs still sent to the daemon but can‚Äôt be used with `ADD`/`COPY`), this pattern risks breaking CI and local builds if not carefully managed ([docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/)).

Please remove these patterns from `archon-ui-main/.dockerignore` (lines 45‚Äì49):

        Original AI Prompt:
        If you prefer not to manage timeouts here, consider extracting a `ProjectCard` component and using the hook inside each card so the local `copied` state is naturally scoped.

I can refactor the card rendering into a small `ProjectCard` component with its own clipboard hook if you‚Äôd like.

        In python/src/server/core/enhanced_dependencies.py around lines 451-452, the
code awaits container.cleanup() but the container's cleanup must be robust:
update the container.cleanup implementation to iterate each registered resource,
await each resource's async cleanup inside individual try/except blocks (or use
asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)) so one failing cleanup doesn't stop
others; log any exceptions with contextual info, optionally aggregate them and
re-raise a combined error after all cleanups complete (or return success with
recorded failures) to ensure all resources are attempted cleaned even if some
fail.

**Enforce hybrid_search weight‚Äêsum validation in repository implementations**

The docstring on `hybrid_search` promises a `ValidationError` when `keyword_weight + vector_weight != 1.0`, but neither the Mock nor Supabase implementations actually check this. To align code with its contract:

‚Ä¢ In **mock_repositories.py** (around line 334):  
  ```diff
     async def hybrid_search(
         self,
         query: str,
         embedding: List[float],
         limit: int = 10,
         source_filter: Optional[str] = None,
-        keyword_weight: float = 0.5,
-        vector_weight: float = 0.5
+        keyword_weight: float = 0.5,
+        vector_weight: float = 0.5
     ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
-    # Simplified implementation ‚Äì just use vector search for mock
+    # Validate weights sum to 1.0
+    if abs((keyword_weight + vector_weight) - 1.0) > 1e-6:
+        raise ValidationError("keyword_weight and vector_weight must sum to 1.0")
+
+    # Simplified implementation ‚Äì just use vector search for mock
     ‚Ä¶
  ```

‚Ä¢ In **supabase_repositories.py** (around line 383):  
  ```diff
     async def hybrid_search(
         self,
         query: str,
         embedding: List[float],
         limit: int = 10,
         source_filter: Optional[str] = None,
-        keyword_weight: float = 0.5,
-        vector_weight: float = 0.5
+        keyword_weight: float = 0.5,
+        vector_weight: float = 0.5
     ) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
-    try:
+    # Validate weights before calling Supabase
+    if abs((keyword_weight + vector_weight) - 1.0) > 1e-6:
+        raise ValidationError("keyword_weight and vector_weight must sum to 1.0")
+
+    try:
         params = {
             'query_text': query,
             'query_embedding': embedding,
             'match_count': limit,
             'keyword_weight': keyword_weight,
             'vector_weight': vector_weight,
         }
  ```

Optionally, we could auto‚Äênormalize the weights instead of erroring (e.g., divide each by their sum) and adjust the docstring accordingly.

Would you like a patch that adds strict validation, optional auto‚Äênormalization, and accompanying unit tests?

returns the project; fix by ensuring the implementation returns the project dict
with a "tasks" key containing the list of associated task dicts (query tasks
table filtering by project_id and attach them to the project before returning),
or if you prefer the lighter change, update this interface docstring to say
"returns the project; tasks fetched separately" and adjust the return
typing/docs accordingly so interface and implementation match. Ensure the chosen
fix keeps the return type Optional[Dict[str, Any]] and clearly documents the
